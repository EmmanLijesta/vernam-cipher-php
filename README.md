# Vernam Cipher in PHP
A high performance vernam cipher in PHP for encoding and decoding plain texts to cipher text. Used in private messaging, cookies and more.

# Credits to the Creator
Vernam cipher, created by Gilber Sandford Vernam (3 April 1890 â€“ 7 February 1960), is a symmetrical stream cipher in which the plaintext is combined with a random or pseudorandom stream of data (the "keystream") of the same length, to generate the ciphertext, using the XOR function.

Vernam also patented a "Secret Signaling System" in July 22, 1919. The NSA has called this patent "perhaps one of the most important in the history of cryptography." Also, the US Army 1925 SIGTOT teletype system was based on Vernam's machine encipherment concept.

Vernam cipher is also called an unbreakable cipher, as long as the key is kept secret.

# How to Use Vcrypt:

Vcrypt sanitizes the text from common code injections and compresses before applying the Vernam Cipher. Thus, provides double security with compression. Average compression for 1500 characters is 48% and processes in <= 0.001ms .

include "vernam-class.php";

$text = "Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house.";

$key = "f0971dbfe2ca3c75b4dac60f087670f2caa19781057abb432a24daee6c915e93";

Encoding

$res = new Vcrypt($text, $key);

$enc = $res->encode();

echo $enc;

Decoding

$res = new Vcrypt($enc, $key);

$dec = $res->decode();

echo $dec;
